# ai-game-agent
AI Game Agent: An intelligent agent trained with reinforcement learning to play games autonomously. Uses Deep Q-Networks to learn optimal strategies by interacting with the environment, maximizing rewards, and improving performance over time.
## Summary

This project implements an AI Game Agent that uses reinforcement learning to interact with a simulated game environment. The agent learns to make optimal decisions based on state observations and rewards, improving its performance over time. The repository includes all source code, utility scripts, and configurations needed to train and test the AI agent efficiently.
